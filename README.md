## 💡 About

When Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) fail at Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) visual reasoning, a fundamental question arises: is it due to perceptual deficiencies or reasoning limitations?.

Through a systematic scaling analysis, we reveal that **perception is the true bottleneck limiting current STEM visual reasoning**. Motivated by this insight, CodePercept introduces a paradigm shift: using **executable code as a powerful perceptual medium**. Because executable code provides precise semantics that naturally align with the structured nature of STEM visuals, it overcomes the hallucinations and "descriptive aphasia" inherent in natural language.

## 🚀 Key Contributions

* **Code-as-Perception Paradigm**: We establish that scaling perception consistently outperforms scaling reasoning in STEM domains.

* **ICC-1M Dataset**: We construct a large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million high-quality STEM Image-Caption-Code triplets. Data is synthesized via three pipelines: Image Reproduce, Image Diversity, and Solid Geometry Synthesis.

* **Novel Training Tasks**:
* **Code-Grounded Caption Generation**: Treats executable code as ground truth for image captions, eliminating hallucinations found in existing knowledge distillation methods.
* **STEM Image-to-Code Translation**: Prompts models to generate reconstruction code, mitigating the ambiguity of natural language descriptions.

* **STEM2Code-Eval Benchmark**: A manually annotated benchmark of 1,000 images that evaluates visual perception through deterministic, executable Python code generation, moving beyond traditional problem-solving accuracy proxies.

Our model is built upon the Qwen3-VL architecture and trained via a two-stage paradigm:

1. **Supervised Finetuning (CodePercept-S1)**: Jointly optimizes image captioning and image-to-code translation using our curated ICC-1M triplets.
2. **Reinforcement Learning (CodePercept-R1)**: We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) specifically targeting code generation. The reward mechanism enforces:
* **Format Reward**: Ensuring valid Python syntax.
* **Content Reward**: Combining execution success, code-level semantic equivalence (via GPT-4o), and image-level visual similarity.





## 📊 Evaluation & Results

CodePercept demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluations:

* **STEM Reasoning Benchmarks**: CodePercept-8B-S1 outperforms super-large models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and approaches the performance of frontier models when paired with a strong LLM solver.

* **STEM2Code-Eval**: On our novel verifiable perception benchmark, CodePercept-8B-R1 achieves an average score of 63.56, significantly surpassing Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct (+16.19) and even super-large models like Qwen3-VL-Plus.
